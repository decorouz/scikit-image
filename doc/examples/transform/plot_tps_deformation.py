Use thin-plate splines for image warping
==========================================

To warp an image, we start with a set of source and target coordinates.
The goal is to deform the image such that the source points move to the target
locations. Typically, we only know the target positions for a few, select
source points. To calculate the target positions for all other pixel positions,
we need a model. Various such models exist, such as `affine or projective
transformations <https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/transform/plot_transform_types.html>`_.

Most transformations are linear (i.e., they preserve straight lines), but
sometimes we need more flexibility. One model that represents a non-linear
transformation, i.e. one where lines can bend, is thin-plate splines [1]_ [2]_.

Thin-plate splines draw on the analogy of a metal sheet, which has inherent
rigidity. Consider our source points: each has to move a certain distance, in
both the x and y directions, to land in their corresponding target positions.
First, examine only the x coordinates. Imagine placing a thin metal plate on
top of the image. Now bend it, such that at each source point, the plate's
z offset is the distance, positive or negative, that that source point has to
travel in the x direction in order to land in its target position. The plate
resists bending, and therefore remains smooth. We can read offsets for
coordinates other than source points from the position of the plate. The same
procedure can be repeated for the y coordinates.

This gives us our thin-plate spline model that maps any (x, y) coordinate to a
target position.

Deform an image
===============

Image deformation implies displacing the pixels of an image relative to one another.
In this example, we deform the (2D) image of an astronaut by using thin-plate splines.
In our image, we define 6 source and target points labeled "1-6": "1-4" are found near
the image corners, "5" near the left smile corner, and "6" in the right eye.
At the "1-4" points, there is no displacement.
Point "5" is displaced upward and point "6" downward.

We use TPS as a very handy interpolator for image deformation.

# Derive an interpolation function

# TPS are used to derive an interpolation function and coefficients from each
# of those points.
# These coefficients can then be used to translate another set of points, in
# the example below called "Original", to a new location matching the original
# deformation between source and target.
