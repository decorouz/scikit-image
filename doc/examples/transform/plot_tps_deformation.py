Interpolate images with thin-plate splines
==========================================

Thin-plate splines (TPS) refer to a method for interpolating data [1]_.
In an image context, we use a 2D generalization of TPS, i.e., a two-dimensional
simulation of a 1D cubic spline, which is the solution of the biharmonic equation [2]_.
According to [3]_, the basic solution of the biharmonic function was expanded.
Given corresponding source and target points, TPS is used to compute
a spatial deformation function for every point in the 2D plane or 3D volume.

It should be noted that the commonly used in image processing
Affine Transformation [4]_ can be understood as special variant of TPS.

This script shows how to use the Thine Plate Spine Transformation for
image warping.

Image Interpolation
===================

In this example we will see how to use thin plate spline interpolation in the
context of image interpolation based on landmarks or control points.

# Deformation
# ===========
# In 2D cases, given a set of K corresponding points, the TPS warp is described by
# `2(K+3)`` parameters which include 6 global affine motion parameters and
# `2K` coefficients for correspondences of the control points.
#
# In this example we compute the coefficients, and then transform an arbitrary
# point from source surface to the deformed surface.
